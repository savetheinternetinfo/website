  "article_content1": "On July 5, 2018, the plenary session of the European Parliament voted on the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0593&from=EN\" class=\"highlight\">reform of copyright in the digital internal market</a>. These two articles, as proposed, would have paved the way for comprehensive censorship of the Internet. For this reason we have created a fortunately very successful petition, which, thanks to the personal invitation of MEP Julia Reda, we were able to present to MEPs immediately before the vote, together with the at that time 736,000 signatures. The untiring efforts of our Members and the enormous number of signatures enabled us to make Members aware of the considerable risk of this reform and thus prevent it from being adopted in plenary. ",
  "article_content2": "The reform proposal on copyright (especially Articles 11 and 13) was rejected by 318 (53%) to 278 (47%)!",
  "article_content3": "However, the threat has not yet completely disappeared! The rejection in plenary simply means that the reform proposal will have to be revised and resubmitted. We expect another vote on a revised version in September.",

As a result, content is often also removed that violates copyright but is protected by citation law. This \"vulnerability\" can be used as an excuse to filter out content that does not correspond to one's own values and ideas.",
  "article_link_title": "Paid",
  "article_link_title_highlight": "Links",
  "article_link_content": "Press publishers should be obliged to charge for all links that someone places on their content. News portals would have lost reach and readership. The resulting loss of revenue would have been offset by the additional costs incurred by a license system to be administered. For many portals and publishers this would have meant economic ruin.",
  "twitter_title": "Hear the voices of others",
  "twitter_description": "Censorship could very soon turn the cultural norms of the web as we know them upside down. Upload locks in combination with error-prone algorithms ensure that even the posting of links will pose a massive problem in the future. This will be particularly evident on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, 9GAG and Co. In fact, most likely all of your favorite websites. Articles 11 and 13 would ensure that links and direct quotes are blacked out or even prevented entirely from uploading.",

Freedom and neutrality have always been the cornerstones of the Internet as we know it and these pillars will remain with us for the time being. Every user retains the right to share what he likes with his friends without fear of copyright lawsuit. This will give us an Internet that we can shape ourselves without fear of government intervention. Just as it has always been in the sense of a worldwide connection of all people.",
  "information_header": "The free and unrestricted flow of information",
  "information_content": "Never before has information and news been distributed around the globe as quickly as today. Everyone has the same access to all this information and messages at all times. This can work because this information is distributed from person to person - through sharing and linking on various platforms. This flow would have been severely curbed by Article 11 - with consequences both for the providers of such information and for the consumer. By rejecting the reform proposal, we were able to maintain free access to information.",
  "freedom_header": "The freedom of the image",
  "freedom_content": "A picture says more than a thousand words. This means that an image not only consists of its obvious content but also conveys a message. This message, made by humans and intended for humans, could never have been recognized, let alone understood, by an automated content recognition technology. Upload filters such as those created under Article 13 would therefore never have been able to fulfil their task.",
  "continue_title": "What's the next move?",
  "continue_content": "The rejected reform proposal must be revised and will then be submitted again. This means that Articles 11 and 13 will no longer come in this form, but it also means that they can come again in another format. MEPs will then have the opportunity to vote on the modified proposal from 10-13 September. The freedom that we have now successfully upheld must continue to be preserved and actively protected by all of us. That is why we must pay close attention to which laws we want to live with, also in the future. And we must not be afraid to raise our voices and participate in our own future.",

  "what_do_content1": "We still need to send a clear signal against upload filters and the like, which is why we will not stop the petition on change.org for the time being. Especially since the next vote is not planned until September, we must not let up now.",

  "graphic_box_title1": "Article 13 in detail",
  "graphic_box_content1": "Article 13 would have demanded in actual practice that almost all Internet platforms install content recognition techniques, with the task of automatically checking uploaded content for potential copyright infringements. Freedom of expression would have been considerably restricted in this way, since the opinion would have fallen victim to deletion even before it had been expressed. Decisions about actually published content and thus its censorship would have been taken over by error-prone and hypersensitive algorithms (programmed in such a way that they \"play it safe\" and delete everything that poses a risk to the platform in case of doubt). Since the programming of these algorithms would be in the hands of a few, it could not have been ruled out that these algorithms would also have been used to sort out unpleasant opinions in advance.",
  "graphic_box_title2": " Article 11 in detail",
  "graphic_box_content2": "The ancillary copyright would have stipulated that the future content of certain information providers is subject to a more concrete press law. The inalienability of these press rights to the respective authors would have made it inevitable that a fee-based licensing system for news would have been created. This licensing could have meant that even quoting texts could have been declared a copyright infringement. However, this would make a complex exchange of views or a more in-depth debate on the Internet almost impossible.",

  "about_sub_title2": "What awaits you:",
  "about_sub_text2_1": "On July 4, the plenary session of the European Parliament will decide on a new copyright reform. This would radically change copyright throughout the EU: instead of strengthening authors as planned, it could burden them even more than ever. ",
  "about_sub_text2_2": "Especially Article 11 and Article 13 of the reform would entail tremendous restrictions, not only for the consumers. Even the creators themselves would suffer under these new regulations:",
  "about_sub_title3": "Ancillary Copyright",
  "about_sub_text3_1": "Article 11 of the proposal of the European Commission is mainly focussing on the Ancillary Copyright of information providers. More specific press rights are going to protect the contents of these providers and will need a purchased license to be able to be used by others. Especially big news portals and aggregators pages are affected since cited texts could be seen as a copyright infringement under these new laws.",
  "about_sub_text3_2": "The problem is simple: A big portion of news providers on the internet are financed by page impressions and the resulting ad income, which is generated by users visiting their site via external links. If a platform is not willing or able to pay these licensing fees, they would lose those page views. The proposed law, originally supposed to support these providers, will now take away their means of existence.",
  "about_sub_title4": "Upload-Filter",
  "about_sub_text4_1": "Implementation of Article 13 results in a total real-time filtering of every piece of content that will be uploaded to the internet. What this means: Every data package will be automatically scanned by a potentially error-prone algorithm. This is comparable to the erroneous algorithm deployed by YouTube, which often mistakenly deletes content that is not protected by copyright law.",
  "about_sub_text4_2": "If you think about the prospect of an algorithm that pre-analyses all the content that is uploaded to the internet, we take a further step towards the Orwellian dystopia of \"1984\". We are on the verge of a drastic reform that could change internet culture forever.",

  "about_us_2_text": "A major information campaign and petition have persuaded many Members of the European Parliament to reject the copyright reform in the digital internal market', which had already been heavily criticised in the run-up.
