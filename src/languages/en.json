  "index_twitter_description": "This form of censorship could very soon destroy the cultural normatives of the internet as we know it. The blocking of uploads, in combination with faulty algorithms, will result in so called overblocking lead by the platforms, so that they can avoid legal violations. Even the sharing of links can become a massive problem on platforms like Twitter, Facebook and others.

MEPs will then have the opportunity to vote on the modified proposal from 10-13 September. The freedom that we have now successfully upheld must continue to be preserved and actively protected by all of us.

Our group has come together via the Internet, but our members live and work all over the German-speaking region. We are acting completely impartially and distance ourselves formally from all political orientations. As a free group of Internet activists, we are economically independent and are constantly expanding our reach. However, we pay very close attention to the anonymity and security of our members.",

  "about_us_2_text": "A major information campaign and petition have persuaded many Members of the European Parliament to reject the copyright reform in the digital internal market', which had already been heavily criticised in the run-up. Our main points of criticism were the threat of censorship on social media sites and the charging for links to news sites, thus slowing down the free flow of information on the Internet.",
  "about_us_3_heading": "How do we work?",
  "about_us_3_text": "Our group is organized through various websites and in constant contact with each other. Our people are active on the streets handing out flyers, making phone calls with politicians, journalists and influencers, organizing demos and information stands or taking care of the website, videos and advertising material. We pursue a purely factual policy and would like to inform people first and foremost about what changes to the law are planned and what effects they will have. It does not matter to us which Member of Parliament is proposing these amendments.",

  "about_us_5_text": "Our campaigns are financed both by the self-financing of the initiators and by the private means of our activists. We were not on anyone's payroll and we reject this for the future. The work of our activists is purely honorary and takes place exclusively in their private free time in order to bring the contents of our campaigns closer to the population.",

Part of this reform were the already heavy critized articles 11 & 13. These articles would've paved the way for massive censorship on the internet.
