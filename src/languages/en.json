These two articles, as proposed, would have paved the way for comprehensive censorship of the Internet. For this reason we have created a fortunately very successful petition, which, thanks to the personal invitation of MEP Julia Reda, we were able to present to MEPs immediately before the vote, together with the at that time 736,000 signatures. The untiring efforts of our Members and the enormous number of signatures enabled us to make Members aware of the considerable risk of this reform and thus prevent it from being adopted in plenary.

This can work because this information is distributed from person to person - through sharing and linking on various platforms.

By rejecting the reform proposal, we were able to maintain free access to information.",

This means that Articles 11 and 13 will no longer come in this form, but it also means that they can come again in another format. MEPs will then have the opportunity to vote on the modified proposal from 10-13 September. The freedom that we have now successfully upheld must continue to be preserved and actively protected by all of us.

  "graphic_box_content1": "Article 13 would have demanded in actual practice that almost all Internet platforms install content recognition techniques, with the task of automatically checking uploaded content for potential copyright infringements. Freedom of expression would have been considerably restricted in this way, since the opinion would have fallen victim to deletion even before it had been expressed. Decisions about actually published content and thus its censorship would have been taken over by error-prone and hypersensitive algorithms (programmed in such a way that they \"play it safe\" and delete everything that poses a risk to the platform in case of doubt). Since the programming of these algorithms would be in the hands of a few, it could not have been ruled out that these algorithms would also have been used to sort out unpleasant opinions in advance.",
  "graphic_box_title2": " Article 11 in detail",
  "graphic_box_content2": "The ancillary copyright would have stipulated that the future content of certain information providers is subject to a more concrete press law. The inalienability of these press rights to the respective authors would have made it inevitable that a fee-based licensing system for news would have been created. This licensing could have meant that even quoting texts could have been declared a copyright infringement. However, this would make a complex exchange of views or a more in-depth debate on the Internet almost impossible.",
